1. Redux.createStore(reducerFunc) method creates a Redux Store, takes in reducerFunc.

2. The Redux Store object provides methods to interact with it like getState() which retrieves the current state in the Redux store.

3. All state updates are triggered by dispatching actions, which are JS objects that contain info about an action event that has occurred.  let action = {type:'LOGIN'} the 'type' property is mandatory.

4. An action creator is a JS function that returns an action (an object that represents action events). 

5. Dispatch method store.dispatch({action object} or actionCreator() function) is what we use to dispatch actions to the Redux Store

6. Once an action is dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of the reducer function. Reducers take state and action as arguments and return a new copy of state.

9. store.subscribe() allows us to add listener function to the store. i.e. a counter which increments everytime an action is dispatched against the store.
